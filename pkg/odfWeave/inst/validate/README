This directory contains a shell script and Python script used
to check that odfWeave produces validate output.  To use this,
you need to have the "jing" utility in your execution path.
For more information on "jing", see:

  http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html

Note that test.sh will copy various files from ../examples, so this
directory needs to be writable in order to execute test.sh.

This directory contains the following files:

  test.sh
    The shell script that drives the processing of ODT files,
    and runs "jing" on the resulting files.

  odf-validate
    A Python script that runs "jing" on the content.xml, styles.xml,
    and META-INF/manifest.xml elements in a specified ODT file.
    Currently, the schema files (listed next) must be in the
    current working directory.

  OpenDocument-v1.2-cd05-schema.rng
    The RELAX NG schema file for the content and styles elements of
    an ODT file (actually, for all XML other than the manifest).

  OpenDocument-v1.2-cd05-manifest-schema.orig
    The original RELAX NG schema file for the manifest of an ODT file.
    My copy of Open Office 3.2.1 doesn't seem to create ODT files
    that validate properly due to a missing "manifest:version"
    attribute.

  OpenDocument-v1.2-cd05-manifest-schema.rng
    The modified RELAX NG schema file for the manifest of an ODT file.
    It makes a "manifest:version" attribute optional.
