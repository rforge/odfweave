----------------------------------
Version: 0.8.0
Date: 2012-6-19

Made various changes suggested by Professor Brian Ripley to
try to correct encoding problems in non-UTF-8 locales.  This
includes:

o Removed examples from man pages that don't work in all
  locales.

o Passed the encoding of content.xml to Sweave.

o Changed the odfWeave driver to re-encode the results from
  Sweave back to UTF-8.

Added a check to see if contents.xml can be converted to the
current locale, and to print an error message if it can't.
Previously, this would result in invalid XML and an obscure
error message.

Fixed the workDir argument to avoid deleting an existing
directory and to handle relative paths properly.

Added "MASS" as a "Suggested" package since it is used in an
example.

----------------------------------
Version: 0.7.17
Date: 2010-12-21

Removed data directory.

Fixed several problems on Windows, mostly related to Unicode
handling.

----------------------------------
Version: 0.7.16
Date: 2010-08-09

Added automated validation tests on the odfWeave examples.

Changed the order of the text-properties and 
paragraph-properties to avoid a validation error.

Fixed list style generation.  This caused incorrect XML, which
caused the Rbullet style to not work.

Encodings for bullet (and other) characters were added by
cran request

----------------------------------
Version: 0.7.13
Date: 2010-06-23

A number of under-the-hood changes.

User-visible changes: 

o new "rgroup" and "cgroup" headers (as are in Hmisc:::latex) 
  that can span multiple cells.

o odfFigureCancel() is added so that you can algorithmically
  determine whether you want to produce a plot or not.

o odfFigureCaption() now has an option called "prefix" that
  can be used to change the caption (e.g. "Illustration 1:"
  to "Figure 1:")
