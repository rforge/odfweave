Version: 0.7.12Date: 2010-06-21

A number of under-the-hood changes.

User-visible changes: 

o new "regroup" and "group" headers (as are in Hmisc:::latex) 
  that can span multiple cells.

o odfFigureCancel() is added so that you can algorithmically
  determine whether you want to produce a plot or not.

o odfFigureCaption() now has an option called "prefix" that
  can be used to change the caption (e.g. "Illustration 1:"
  to "Figure 1:")
