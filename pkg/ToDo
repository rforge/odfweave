 - work-around for "slim" styles.xml files
 - improve man files
 - write vingette+FAQ 
 - parse <<>> to look for fig= TRUE and 
   automatically save and insert image files
 - utilize table column formats: right now, 
   only doubles and strings are supported 
   and doubles are rounded instead of writing
   full precision into file and only displaying
   desired precision
 - another style arg to specify the style
   of every cell in the table and different
   styles for different columns
 - test with Calc and Impress
 - allow lists with multiple sub-lists
